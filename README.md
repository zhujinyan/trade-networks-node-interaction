To use the code for research, follow the steps:

- Use `new-crawler` to get the raw data of specific HS product
- Use `cal-adjcent` to get the adjcent matrix of the trade network
- (Optional) Use `cal-network-matrix` to calculate some existing network matrix
- Use `sim_attack` to get the attack result of our current algorithm
  - You can use other code for attack. The difference is listed as comment.
